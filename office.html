  <h2>Office Policies/Mission</h2>
    <p>We are open to serve you, answer questions or schedule an appointment during the following hours:
      <br>Monday – Thursday: 7:30 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.<br>2:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.
      <br>Friday: 7:30 a.m. – 11:30 a.m.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>It is our goal to help your child achieve a smile for a lifetime. We hope that every visit to our office is pleasant and enjoyable, and we will strive to provide quality dental care for your child.</p>
    <h2>Appointments</h2>
    <p>Your scheduled appointment time has been reserved specifically for you. We request 24-hours notice if you need to cancel your appointment for a routine cleaning and 48-hours notice if you need to cancel a sedation or restorative appointment. We are aware that unforeseen events sometimes require missing an appointment, and appreciate your cooperation.</p>
    <h2>Insurance</h2>
    <p>Our office is committed to helping you maximize your insurance benefits. Because insurance policies vary, we can only estimate your coverage in good faith but cannot guarantee coverage due to the complexities of insurance contracts. Your estimated patient portion must be paid at the time of service. As a service to our patients, we will bill insurance companies for services. If you have any questions, our courteous staff is always available to answer them.</p>
