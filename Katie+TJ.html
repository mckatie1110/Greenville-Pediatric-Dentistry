    <center><h2>How We Met</h2>
        <p>TJ and I met in January of 2014 at a small group get together at Gravitopia.  We had been chatting over email and facebook since he first saw me at Brookwood.  We continued to talk a lot on facebook and see each other on Fridays for small group. I loved hearing how passionate he was about his relationship with God.  As we got to know each other better, TJ eventually found out that I had never seen the Star Wars movies!  Over the next few weeks we started meeting with friends to watch them all.  TJ started volunteering with me as a leader for high school ministry at church, and we started spending more time together.<p>

        <p>March TJ asked me out on our first date!  On March 15th we went downtown to The Pomegranate on Main and had a lovely dinner on the patio.  After dinner we walked around downtown and talked for hours! It was the best first date I’d ever been on, but I still was not sure if I wanted to be in a relationship yet.  I told Tj I needed some time to think about it and he waited patiently.  We continued talking and hanging out with friends, but didn’t go out on another date again until late April.</p>

        <p>We finally went “facebook official” in May and have been going out on amazing dates and getting to know each other better ever since :)</p>

    <center><h2>The Proposal</h2></center>
<p>Katie and I have truly wanted to be married for a while, but as many of you know timing of engagement and marriage is an important consideration past choosing the right one. I settled on the first idea of a proposal just the week before thanksgiving in 2015. A hike up to rainbow falls would be a sure way to make a romantic memory for us to tell.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the first attempt at this did not go so well. The GPS took us right to rainbow falls but instead of finding an expected trail, we found Pretty Place which is an overlook that happens to be several thousand feet straight above rainbow falls. The beginning of the hike was truly a 2.5 hour drive around the side of the mountain. A local park ranger agreed we would not be able to make it before they closed the gate for the day. In a panic, I decided the stars were not aligning for a proposal today. We went on a smaller hike there by the ranger station and saw a couple small waterfalls that just didn't compare to what we had expected to see that day.</p>

<p>With impatience of waiting until Spring for another sunny day to go on the planned hike to rainbow falls, I hatched a new plan at a local spot in Greenville. My job was to ensure it was all a big surprise. Upon receiving results from taking the Professional Engineering Exam that I had taken last Fall, I invited Katie on a celebratory date to downtown Greenville. Reservations were set at the restaurant Larkins on the River with outdoor patio seating next to the water. With plenty of time to spare per our reservations Katie and I walked down by the Reedy Falls Park. We walked down towards the falls and found a beautiful overlook half way down to the green below the bridge with a direct view of the falls. At roughly 6:10 PM on Friday December 11th, I pulled Katie’s arm back from continuing back down the path, said a few words about how I perfect we were for each other and how much I appreciated her patience over this last year, got down on one knee and asked her to marry me. She said YES! We proceeded to walking  back towards main street for our dinner reservations with the sound of people above on the bridge and those behind us on the walking trail clapping and cheering for us as the proposal was a complete success!</p>

<p>Katie never expected anything like this to happen on that day. Our dinner at Larkins was excellent and we immediately began calling all of our family about the news. We are absolutely ecstatic about our marriage plans and we are looking forward to seeing you there!</p>
