  <h1>Dental Health</h1>
  <h2>Why Good Dental Health is Important</h2>
    <p>Innumerable studies and research have concluded on the importance of starting children early in their lives with good dental hygiene and oral care. According to research, the most common chronic childhood disease in America is tooth decay, affecting 50 percent of first-graders and 80 percent of 17-year-olds. Early treatment prevents problems affecting a child’s health, well-being, self-image and overall achievement.</p>
    <p>The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research estimates that children will miss 52 million hours of school each year due to oral health problems and about 12.5 million days of restricted activity every year from dental symptoms. Because there is such a significant loss in their academic performance, the Surgeon General has made children’s oral health a priority.</p>
    <p>Parents are responsible for ensuring their children practice good dental hygiene. Parents must introduce proper oral care early in a child's life—as early as infancy.</p>
    <p>The American Dental Hygiene Association states that a good oral hygiene routine for children includes:
        <ul><li>Thoroughly cleaning your infant’s gums after each feeding with a water-soaked infant cloth. This stimulates the gum tissue and removes food.</li>
            <li>By brushing your child's teeth as soon as they erupt, you are teaching them at the earliest age about proper brushing techniques.  Prior to age one, you may use a wash cloth of finger brush or a small, soft bristled toothbrush and water or training, non-fluoridated toothpaste.  After age one, you may use a small, soft bristled tootbrush and a smear or up to a pea-sized amount of fluoridated toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Regular visits with their dentist to check for cavities in the primary teeth and for possible developmental problems.</li>
            <li>Encouraging your child to discuss any fears they may have about oral health visits, but not mentioning words like “pain” or “hurt,” since this may instill the possibility of pain in the child’s thought process.</li>
            <li>Determining if the water supply that serves your home is fluoridated; if not, discussing supplement options with your dentist or hygienist.</li>
            <li>Asking your hygienist or dentist about sealant applications to protect your child’s teeth-chewing surfaces and about bottle tooth decay, which occurs when teeth are frequently exposed to sugared liquids.</li></ul></p>
