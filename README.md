Dentist Office Site
===================

Project 1 for Iron Yard
-----------------------

This is my first website project! After about seven weeks of learning each step to building a website, this is almost the final step!  There are still some edits and additional pages I would like to add to this site later.  
This project was a website redesign.  Each student was assigned a dentist website.  Mine was www.greenvillepediatricdentistry.com
