  <h1>Treatment</h1>
    <h2>General Treatment</h2>
    <p>Our practice can provide a wide range of dental services for your children. Our flexibility in our services saves you time and keeps your total dental care within one practice. Our emphasis is on total preventive care for our patients. Total care begins with regular hygiene visits,
      regular checkups and continued home oral health routines.</p>
    <p>We provide many preventative measures to keep your child’s teeth clean and healthy, including sealants and fluoride treatments. We also educate the parents in early<p>detection of some common problems children may face, including thumb sucking, bruxism and baby bottle tooth decay.
    <p>Our primary goal for your children’s dental development is to achieve and maintain optimum oral health through advances in techniques, technologies and by maintaining their scheduled dental exams.</p>
