  <h1>Financial Information
  <h2>Insurance</h2>
    <p>Your treatment plan will include a breakdown of all applicable fees, and we will inform you of all costs before treatment is administered.  Dental needs can change during treatment if the decay is smaller or larger than anticipated.  If you provide us with your insurance information, we attempt to find out from your insurance company how much they will cover of the applicable fees.  We then estimate what your portion will be once insurance has paid.  Payment is expected at the time treatment is rendered, unless special arrangements have been made prior to your appointment.  Please note that while insurance companies do give you a quote either on the phone or in writing, they will not guarantee that they will in fact pay that amount.  Therefore, we do not know for sure until the treatment is rendered and payment from the insurance company is received.  If we are unable to find out from your insurance company the portion they will cover, we ask that you pay half of the estimated total fee.  Once insurance has paid, we will refund you any over-payment or send you a statement for the remaining balance.
    </p><p>Additionally, we will submit all insurance claims for you for your convenience. We will fully attempt to help you receive full insurance benefits; however, you are personally responsible for your account, and we encourage you to contact us if your policy has not paid within 30 days.</p>
